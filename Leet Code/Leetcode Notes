11.Container With Most Water
Two Pointer Problem
Solution: Create pointers at both ends of the list and bring them in, checking if area
of water increases
Always bring in the shorter side (moving in taller side will never increase area), as it 
is what limits the height of the area

Prev attempts: Tried finding the two tallest heights and moving out from that
Kept trying to optimize left side first and then right side, should've been optimizing the 
shorter side.
