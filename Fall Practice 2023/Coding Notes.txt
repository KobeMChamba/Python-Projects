Lego Blocks
Problem requirements:
Calculate the number of ways an nxm wall can be built with 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4 blocks
Walls may not have vertical breaks or holes
 
Solution:
Create a base case for combinations of 1x0,1x1,1x2,1x3 walls
Sum last 4 cases of the wall and append to end of the list
continue to do so until list has the number of combinations for an m sized wall of height 1

Calculate combinations for N tall wall
set combinations to nth power for each width

Remove unstable combinations
No holes in our combinations, only need to find vertical breaks
No unstable combinations in 1x0 or 1x1
